# Dynamic Schema Generation for Changing Data Models

**Abstract:**

> Designing *one* API is hard. Aiming to find the perfect sweet spot, a lot of decisions are to be made, so every API consumer gets what they need.
> In our case the API surface changes between every single of our customers. Learn about design decisions & trade-offs when designing a *thousand* APIs at once.
