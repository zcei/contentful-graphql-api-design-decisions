# Dynamic Schema Generation
## for Changing Data Models
---
# There are well-thought GraphQL APIs out there

* https://youtu.be/2It9NofBWYg - Leanne Shapton (Shopify)
* https://youtu.be/wPPFhcqGcvk - Kyle Daigle (GitHub)

```notes
Hurts in a good way somehow

Leanne talks about how to tackle the API design.
Kyle's topic is about the how GitHub internally had to change to build GraphQL
```

---
# GitHub / Shopify

* multiple users, but single schema
* every design decision is on point

```notes
How you group properties, how to link between them?
When is it an array, when is it a collection?
```

---
# Contentful

* content infrastructre
* customers define the shape of their content

```notes
* Ecosystem out there is not to accomodate for our use case
* Most tooling is for single static schemas
* Reflection over DB schema, or generate from SDL
```
---
# Shift of responsibility

* historically we decided how the API looks like
* now we only explain *how the API is derived*

```notes
REST:
* we give the shape (sys / fields, items / skip / limit)
* everything in fields is user respoinsibility

GraphQL:
* staticly typed
* we need to inspect the available content types
* schema is generated from existing knowledge, like linkContentType validation
```

---
# Other option

> Let the user describe the schema they want in SDL

* doubled effort when changing the shape
* hard for us to understand the user intention without new syntax

```notes
* We dismissed the idea pretty fast
* Is still an option for later to allow fine-grained tuning of the schema`
```

---
# 1. Design Decision

> It's a greenfield *view layer*, not a greenfield app

---
* at best, no changes to the models are needed
* the same internal data query adapter is used
* we can break with expectations where necessary

```notes
* we operate on data that looks more or less like the current REST responses
* this format is provided by an internal models library

THE BEST THING
* we don't need to keep backwards compatibility "at any cost"
* people have to adapt to the new API either way
* we can fix annoying little things like protocol-relative urls
```

---
# Second Design Decision

> Content Type IDs are used for type names

```notes
* typenames are PascalCase as a general convention in GraphQL
```
---
import { Image } from 'mdx-deck'

<Image src='images/restaurant-model.png' size='110vh' />
---

In the example before, everything is obvious: the type name should be `Restaurant`.
But what about:

---
<Image src='images/category-model.png' size='120vh' />

---
* different name and ID
* name can be changed, ID cannot
* (auto-generated IDs can be invalid, starting with a number)

Is it `Category` or `FoodCategoryCuisine`?

```notes
* We analysed all content type ids and names
* IDs had a bigger percentile failing
* We started by pascal-casing the names
* Eventually settled for IDs - those old spaces were ignored for the moment
```

---
# Third design descision

> Content Type validations are re-used to derive links between types

---
<Image src='images/restaurant-type.png' size='150vh' />
---
<Image src='images/restaurant-categories-type.png' size='90vh' />
---
import { SplitRight } from 'mdx-deck/layouts'

export default SplitRight

## No links defined

<Image src='images/query-without-validations.png'  />
---

export default SplitRight

## With links defined

<Image src='images/query-with-validations.png'  />
---
<Image src='images/restaurant-categories-validations-type.png' size='90vh' />

```notes
Note how the `items` type did change
```
---
# Fourth design descision

> the generated type namespace is user-owned

---

* fields like `sys` are colocated in the same namespace
* no `fields` indirection
* field IDs can be changed

```notes
* as the field IDs can be changed, we "don't care" about naming clashes
* of course we do not occupy frequent names
* this means we don't hoist `sys` properties like `createdAt`

* with every error we try to be as explicit as possible
```

---
import { FullScreenCode } from 'mdx-deck/layouts'

export default FullScreenCode

## Useful error messages

```graphql
{
  errors: [{
    message: "Schema generation failed. The type generated from the content type 'blog' contains a field with id 'sys' which is reserved.",
    extensions: {
      contentful: {
        code: 'RESERVED_FIELD_NAME',
        details: {
          contentTypeId: 'blog',
          fieldId: 'sys'
        },
        requestId: 'xxx'
      }
    }
  }]
}
```

# Latest design decision

> keep everything in GraphQL land

```notes
* GraphQL is (or should be) transport independent
* don't rely on querystring
```
---

* we use the `context` to cascade configuration
* this allows to specify the `locale` as an argument

---

<Image src='images/cascading-locale-query.png' size='150vh' />

---

## Awesome side effects

* switching between *languages* is possible
* switching between *published* and *preview* content is possible

---

<Image src='images/cascading-locale-override.png' size='150vh' />

---

<Image src='images/cascading-preview-override.png' size='150vh' />

```notes
* once `preview: true` is used anywhere
  * the whole HTTP response won't be cached
  * a preview access token is necessary
```

---

Try it out today:
https://graphql.contentful.com

.../content/v1/spaces/$SPACE_ID

.../explore?access_token=$ACCESS_TOKEN

```notes
* main URL brings you to our documentation

* add /content/v1 to reach the API I've been talking about the last minutes
* keeps us a clean namespace for other GraphQL APIs

* add /explore with an access token to spin up GraphiQL
* GraphiQL is exception here to the last design decision
```
